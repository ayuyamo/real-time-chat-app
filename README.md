This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## TODO 
- visuals (nothing has been done for frontend stuff, i.e. make it so messages were on the left if they were sent by other users and on the right if sent by current logged-in user)
- test chat room page display with different users
- deploy website & check chat app performance
- maybe add more features like which user have read the message, time message was sent or ability to modify & delete sent messages
- document all the code for the backend ( Halie )
- display warning if user tries to enter chat room without signing in
- add feature to allow user to select their profile image
- enable user to put emojis in text messages
- adjust user view on mobile devices
